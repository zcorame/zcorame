## Welcome! ğŸ¦„

Hi! I'm Zefanya Ratna Palupi Rut Carianto, but you can call me Zefa. I'm from Grobogan, Central Java.

I'm a Geophysics student at Gadjah Mada University with a keen interest in studying Earth's natural phenomena and editing. I'm an organized individual who loves to learnÂ newÂ things! and my funfact is I'm a Baymax fan ğŸ‘½
