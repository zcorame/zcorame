## Welcome! 🐱

Hi! I'm Zefanya Ratna Palupi Rut Carianto, but you can call me Zefa. I'm from Grobogan, Central Java.

I'm a Geophysics student at Gadjah Mada University with a keen interest in studying Earth's natural phenomena and editing. I'm an organized individual who loves to learn new things! 

My funfact is I love cats and I'm a Baymax fan 👽
